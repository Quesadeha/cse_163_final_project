Testing Strategy Summary:
    In order to test that our maps were representing the correct data,
    at every step of filtering the CSV data, we checked what the resulting
    DataFrame was. We did this by converting the dataframe to a CSV file.
    * data.to_csv('test.csv')
    This helped us find out when we were filtering out too much data. For
    example, many of our graphs had missing data, meaning the counties were gray.
    After looking at the csv data, we noticed that we were missing rows for certain
    counties. This was the result of dropping null values before filtering the
    dataset down to the columns we were analyzing. In the end, we decided not to
    drop null values at all, because averaging the graduation rates did not take
    null values into the computation. 

    Another example is when we wanted to represent Gender X in a graph, but
    when we filtered down to the Gender X graduation average for each county,
    we had an empty dataframe. We converted our filtered data to a csv file and
    saw this...

    ,County,StudentGroup,GraduationRate
    64,Snohomish,Female,0.7709613137096876
    65,Snohomish,Male,0.7241602641629047
    66,Spokane,Female,0.8171093481376861
    67,Spokane,Gender X,
    68,Spokane,Male,0.7682177546355423
    ...

    Gender X, had missing graduation rates throughout the whole dataset. After discovering
    this, we learned that we could only represent male and female graduation rates throughout
    Washington state. 

    Another way we decided to check that our code was making sure we were all filtering
    our datasets down in the same way. Our requirements were that the years must be 2014-15
    to 2018-19, Cohort must be Year 7, and the columns 'SchoolYear', 'County', 'StudentGroupType',
    'StudentGroup', 'Cohort', 'GraduationRate' must all be included. We had to use this
    when we wanted to represent English Language Learners and our
    resulting graph looked the same color for each county. The legend said that the
    average graduation rate for each county was above 80%. Looking at how we filtered down
    that particular dataset, we discovered that we forgot the parameter that 
    data['Cohort'] == 'Seven Year'. 

    Lastly, we confirmed that the average graduation rate for each county correlated to
    the average dropout rate. Our resulting data set looked like...

    ,County,StudentGroup,GraduationRate,Dropout
    0,Adams,All Students,0.7981019444986759,0.20189805550123793
    1,Asotin,All Students,0.667196007270345,0.332803992729555
    2,Benton,All Students,0.7760854665495631,0.22221114781663803
    3,Chelan,All Students,0.8013508467070143,0.1986142078078482
    4,Clallam,All Students,0.6983684104912568,0.30147712329146864
    5,Clark,All Students,0.8253041074204157,0.1744396954189425
    ...

    By computing the total average percentage for each of these counties we see..

    ,County,StudentGroup,GraduationRate,Dropout, Sum
    0,Adams: 0.7981019444986759 + 0.20189805550123793 = 1
    1,Asotin,All Students,0.667196007270345 + 0.332803992729555 = 1
    2,Benton,All Students,0.7760854665495631 + 0.22221114781663803 = 0.9982966144
    3,Chelan,All Students,0.8013508467070143 + 0.1986142078078482 = 0.9999650545
    4,Clallam,All Students,0.6983684104912568 + 0.30147712329146864 = 0.9998455338
    5,Clark,All Students,0.8253041074204157 + 0.1744396954189425 = 0.9997438028

    From this we can see that the average graduation rate and drop out rate
    from 5 school years sums up to be around 99%. This confirms that our data is
    accurate and we effectively averaged our data.
