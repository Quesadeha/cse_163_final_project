Testing Strategy Summary

    Strategies While Testing Smaller Graphs:

        In order to test that our maps were representing the correct data,
    at every step of filtering the CSV data, we checked what the resulting
    DataFrame was. We did this by converting the dataframe to a CSV file.
    * data.to_csv('test.csv')

        This helped us find out when we were filtering out too much data. For
    example, many of our graphs had missing data, meaning the counties were gray.
    After looking at the csv data, we noticed that we were missing rows for certain
    counties. This was the result of dropping null values before filtering the
    dataset down to the columns we were analyzing. In the end, we decided not to
    drop null values at all, because averaging the graduation rates did not take
    null values into the computation. 

        Another example is when we wanted to represent Gender X in a graph, but
    when we filtered down to the Gender X graduation average for each county,
    we had an empty dataframe. We converted our filtered data to a csv file and
    saw this...

    ,County,StudentGroup,GraduationRate
    64,Snohomish,Female,0.7709613137096876
    65,Snohomish,Male,0.7241602641629047
    66,Spokane,Female,0.8171093481376861
    67,Spokane,Gender X,
    68,Spokane,Male,0.7682177546355423
    ...

        Gender X, had missing graduation rates throughout the whole dataset. After discovering
    this, we learned that we could only represent male and female graduation rates throughout
    Washington state. 

        Another way we decided to check that our code was making sure we were all filtering
    our datasets down in the same way. Our requirements were that the years must be 2014-15
    to 2018-19, Cohort must be Year 7, and the columns 'SchoolYear', 'County', 'StudentGroupType',
    'StudentGroup', 'Cohort', 'GraduationRate' must all be included. We had to use this
    when we wanted to represent English Language Learners and our resulting graph looked the
    same color for each county. The legend said that the average graduation rate for each
    county was above 80%. Looking at how we filtered down that particular dataset, we
    discovered that we forgot the parameter that data['Cohort'] == 'Seven Year'. 

        Lastly, we confirmed that the average graduation rate for each county correlated to
    the average dropout rate. Our resulting data set looked like...

    ,County,StudentGroup,GraduationRate,Dropout
    0,Adams,All Students,0.7981019444986759,0.20189805550123793
    1,Asotin,All Students,0.667196007270345,0.332803992729555
    2,Benton,All Students,0.7760854665495631,0.22221114781663803
    3,Chelan,All Students,0.8013508467070143,0.1986142078078482
    4,Clallam,All Students,0.6983684104912568,0.30147712329146864
    5,Clark,All Students,0.8253041074204157,0.1744396954189425
    ...

    By computing the total average percentage for each of these counties we see..

    ,County,StudentGroup,GraduationRate,Dropout, Sum
    0,Adams: 0.7981019444986759 + 0.20189805550123793 = 1
    1,Asotin,All Students,0.667196007270345 + 0.332803992729555 = 1
    2,Benton,All Students,0.7760854665495631 + 0.22221114781663803 = 0.9982966144
    3,Chelan,All Students,0.8013508467070143 + 0.1986142078078482 = 0.9999650545
    4,Clallam,All Students,0.6983684104912568 + 0.30147712329146864 = 0.9998455338
    5,Clark,All Students,0.8253041074204157 + 0.1744396954189425 = 0.9997438028

        From this we can see that the average graduation rate and drop out rate
    from 5 school years sums up to be around 99%. This confirms that our data is
    accurate and we effectively averaged our data.


    Strategies While Testing Interactive Maps:

        As for testing the code for creating merged the high school graduation rates, college enrollment,
    and geometry datasets, as well as the code that created the interactive maps, there were a few main
    strategies. We did not use a test file for this because it would have been extremely difficult to
    implement test functions that checked whether our DataFrames or maps were exactly correct. 
        
        Therefore, while writing the code that trimed and filtered the columns and rows in each dataset, we made
    sure to save our DataFrames to CSV files at different stages in the process. 
        * data.to_csv('test.csv')
   
         We proceeded to open these files ourselves and check to make sure that the correct columns were included,
    the filters had the intended effect, and there were no other kinds of undesired effects. By doing this,
    we caught a lot of errors that could have manifested themselves in the final product and thrown off our
    analysis. 

	    For instance, after doing this we discovered Garfield and Columbia county only had data for one year.
    These empty rows were much easier to discover in a filtered CSV file with only a few hundred rows than
    in a file with hundreds of thousands of rows.

        Additionally, this practice showed us that some rows of the graduation rate dataset were effectively
    being duplicated when we merged it with the enrollment dataset, allowing us to target a fix for this
    problem.
 
        A third benefit from saving and examining our DataFrames  as CSV files at intermediate stages is
    that we learned our initial groupby indexed the data by county and year, prompting us to set the
    as_index parameter to False.

        In creating the interactive maps, there were a couple of ways that we ensured these maps had been
    deployed as intended. When we first generated the maps, we were surprised and concerned by the fact
    that our map was shaped slightly differently than how Washington looks on a map. We quickly realized
    that this was because no waterways were included in the map, so county borders that contained bodies of
    water (especially the Sound) made the map look strange. After we checked our maps against other maps
    depicting Washington county borders, we were certain that the geometry data had been used correctly.
    Next, we made sure to check that the rates attributed to counties were correct by manually checking our rates against available government data. 
    
        As an example, we were skeptical of the data in Whitman County because it has low population density,
    but had extremely high graduation and 4-year college enrollment rates for the 5 cohorts we analyzed data
    on. We were able to verify that our data on the county was accurate after examining a page on
        * towncharts.com 
    that showed Whitman County has a much higher percentage of bachelorâ€™s degree attainment than other
    counties in the state of Washington.
